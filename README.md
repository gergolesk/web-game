# Web-Game MultiPacman

## Quick Start

This project includes a Node.js backend (`server` folder) and a frontend client (`client` folder). You can launch both the server and the client simultaneously using a single command for convenience and cross-platform compatibility.

### 1. Install Dependencies

**Run this only once** after cloning or downloading the project:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies and tools locally (including the server and `http-server` for the client).

---

### 2. Run the Project

To start both the server and the client at the same time, run:

```bash
npm start
```

- The server will start from the `server` folder.
- The client will be available at [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500).

Both processes will run in parallel.  
Press `Ctrl+C` to stop both processes at any time.
